This paper explores attacks on \ac{iot} devices through exploitation of the physics of the sensors that they rely on. We implemented a simple thermocouple interference experiment demonstrating how a thermocouple could be interfered with remotely. As a solution to this problem, we implemented a software-based controller that can detect interference and replace the faulty data with a steady-state model of the thermocouple.
